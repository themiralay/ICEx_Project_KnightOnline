# ICEx_Project_KnightOnline
* It is a 3rd party bot project that connects to Knight Oline Exe application with dll inject. 
* Written entirely in C# .NET 4.8. For it to work, you need to update the pointer and offsets of the KO application using a ReverseEnginnering tool (like OllyDbg or IDA Debugger..).
* This project was made for hobby purposes.
* Responsibility for bans or any illegal situation you will make in your in-game use belongs to the user.
